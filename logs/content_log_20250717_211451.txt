Script:
[Introduction]
Narrator (whispering conspiratorially): Imagine a world where dinosaurs roamed not just the earth but also your living room. What if these ancient creatures were your roommates, causing chaos at every turn? Hold on tight as we unravel why dinosaurs would've been the worst housemates in history.

[Body]
Narrator (dropping revelations): They didn’t go extinct. They just got evicted for noise complaints. Yes, that's right. The real reason dinosaurs disappeared from the planet was not a cataclysmic event but rather their inability to keep the volume down.

Narrator (yelling red flag): T-Rex couldn’t do dishes. Arms too short. Excuses too long. Can you imagine the mess in the kitchen if a massive Tyrannosaurus Rex was your roommate? Plates piled up, food scraps everywhere – a disaster waiting to happen.

Narrator (building slow horror): Imagine waking up at 2 a.m. to the sound of claws on hardwood. The unmistakable sound of a velociraptor prowling the halls, looking for a late-night snack. Sleepless nights would become the norm with these prehistoric predators lurking around your home.

Narrator (whispering conspiratorially): The triceratops invented passive aggression. Picture coming home to find passive-aggressive notes written in ancient hieroglyphics, hinting at your roommate's displeasure over shared spaces and belongings. The tension would be palpable.

Narrator (yelling red flag): We lost our deposit because the velociraptor used the bathtub as a meat locker. The horror of discovering your bathroom turned into a makeshift storage space for raw meat by your reptilian housemate – a nightmare scenario no security deposit could cover.

[Conclusion]
Narrator: In conclusion, while dinosaurs may have been fascinating creatures from afar, having them as roommates would have been a disaster waiting to happen. From noisy neighbors to messy housemates, the chaos they would bring into your life is a saga best left in the past. Remember, be grateful for your human roommates – they may not be perfect, but at least they don't have claws and teeth to contend with.
